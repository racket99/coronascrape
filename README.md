# Corona Virus Scrape Tool

The scraper pulls data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus into a jupyter notebook. From there you can do basic plots and analysis using your favorite stats tools. 

From cloned directory, run the following commands to install required packages: 

```console
pipenv install --python=3.6
pip install requests pandas bs4 matplotlib
```

Then you should be all set to run the notebook.
